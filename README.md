# SuperMemoPolaco
Java + SQLite

I wanted to learn spanish that is why I created this application. It is a kind of super memo app with spanish-polish vocabulary.

Classes:

    1. DatabaseHelper - to handle SQLite DB and db methods.
    2. MainActivity - to handle main page activities.
    3. Espanol and Espanol2 - 2 screens with "spanish" activities. 
    4. Polish and Polish2 - 2 screens with "polish" activities.
    
Layout:

    1. activity_main.xml - main page design.
    2. espanol.xml and espanol2.xml - 2 screens with "spanish" design. 
    3. polish.xml and polish2.xml - 2 screens with "polish" design.
    
    
I still learn spanish :)
